# PascalsTriangle

This is a tool to build Pascal's Triangle. One can specify the number of rows the script will compute, format and display it on screen.<br>
The basic format is as follows:

```
          1           
         1 1          
        1 2 1         
       1 3 3 1        
      1 4 6 4 1       
    1 5 10 10 5 1     
   1 6 15 20 15 6 1   
 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1  
1 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1
```

The script was written using C#. Feel free to [open issues](//github.com/bored-user/PascalsTriangle/issues) and [pull requests](//github.com/bored-user/PascalsTriangle/pulls).
